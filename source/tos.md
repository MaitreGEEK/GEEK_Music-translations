**Updated Terms of Service**

1. **About Us**

We are self-proclaimed developers and independent artists, enjoying Discord and wanting to contribute to its history.

2. **Preamble**

We invite Users to carefully read these General Terms of Use (ToS). The use of the software/bot implies acceptance of these conditions. The product's features are indicated in the bot’s description and documentation. It is the user's responsibility to take them into account.

In the event of subsequent changes to the ToS, the User is subject to the version in force at the time of use.

3. **Definition**

- **"Users"**: Includes all individuals using the software/bot.
- **"Software/bot"**: Refers in this context to "GEEK Music," which is the application allowing interaction between users and the features of the same software.
- **"Description"**: Discord has a profile system; it contains, below the user or software name, a section commonly called "about me," which will primarily be used here for basic information.

4. **Payment Related**

The bot includes a paid service offering hosting of a bot instance for personal use. Users have the right to withdraw from this service within 15 days from the date of purchase. A 15-day free usage period is provided without a valid payment; if this duration is exceeded, the service will be withdrawn. Payments are due regardless of service status. In cases of degraded service, we will strive to offer commercial gestures for compensation.

For donations, we provide a site listing the various donation methods available: **[https://donate.maitregeek.eu](https://donate.maitregeek.eu)**. **Any association may, without special authorization, receive manual donations.**

5. **Modifications**

We reserve the right to modify the ToS, the bot’s features, and all associated rates or terms at any time. By using the bot, the User agrees to the stipulations in the current ToS.

6. **Processing and Sharing of Personal Data**

No registration is required for the bot. To use the software's features, the User must have a Discord account. No personal data is recorded by us. Only the words written during a command are kept in memory for the duration of the command's execution. No information is resold or stored in the long term in any way.

For detailed information on how personal data is handled, please refer to our **Privacy Policy**.

7. **Data Protection**

As a Discord user, the User's data is protected by Discord. If the User encounters any problems with their personal data within Discord, they should contact Discord support, as we are not responsible for such matters.

8. **Functionality Disclaimer**

The bot functions as a music player or cassette deck. It provides tools for Users to listen to sounds that they send in the form of links or files (converted into temporary or permanent links). Users are fully responsible for the content they use within the bot and must ensure they have the legal right to do so. Additionally, we are not responsible for the availability of the links Users provide. We strive to support as many formats as possible.

9. **Intellectual Property**

The brand, logo, and graphic charter of this bot are intellectual works protected under copyright and are exclusively owned by us. Any dissemination, exploitation, representation, or reproduction, whether partial or complete, without prior authorization will expose the infringer to civil and criminal proceedings.

10. **Jurisdiction Clause**

The law governing the ToS is French law. Any disputes arising between the Company and a User will be subject to an attempt at amicable resolution. If unresolved, disputes will fall under the jurisdiction of the French courts.

11. **Responsibility**

If a User encounters a problem with the bot, they can contact our support team for assistance. However, we are not responsible for the unavailability of the bot due to hosting issues. We will make every effort to resolve such problems promptly.

12. **Contact Information**

For support, complaints, or suggestions, please:

- Send an email to **[contact@maitregeek.eu](mailto\:contact@maitregeek.eu)**
