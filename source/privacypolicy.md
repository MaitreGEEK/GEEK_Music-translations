**Privacy Policy**  

We collect the information you publicly transmit while using Discord: your unique user ID and username. These are used for the following purposes:  
- Displaying your details on a leaderboard and tracking your listening time on the bot to compile your listening statistics.  
- Retaining your user ID to assign playlists to their respective owners (you, the creator).  

If you wish to have this data deleted, please send an email to **contact@maitregeek.eu** or open a support ticket via the bot or our Discord server at **[https://discord.gg/XaJ3GmV8eT](https://discord.gg/XaJ3GmV8eT)**.  

Additionally, when you add songs to your playlist, their links are stored along with details like the title and duration. This allows us to save the state of your playlist for future use.  

**Important Information:**  
- Do not confuse the **queue** (the currently playing music list, which is temporary and is deleted once playback stops or the bot leaves the voice channel) with a **playlist** (a user-created, editable list of tracks stored long-term).  
- User data will be automatically deleted if the user has not interacted with the bot for **5 years**.  

By using this bot, you agree to the aforementioned data collection and handling practices. If you do not consent, we encourage you not to use the bot, as its functionality depends on this data.
